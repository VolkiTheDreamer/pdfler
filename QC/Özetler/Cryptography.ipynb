It provides simple, easy-to-use APIs for common cryptographic tasks (like symmetric encryption with Fernet). The goal here is to minimize the chances of developers making common cryptographic mistakes by providing sensible defaults and abstracting away complex details.\n","    * **Hazmat Layer:** This is the low-level layer, found within the `cryptography.hazmat` package. It exposes the raw cryptographic building blocks. While powerful and flexible, it requires a much deeper understanding of cryptographic concepts to use correctly. The name \"hazmat\" is a clear warning: using these primitives incorrectly can lead to severe security vulnerabilities.\n","\n","* **Why a Hazmat Layer?**\n","    * **Flexibility:** It allows advanced users to implement custom cryptographic protocols or fine-tune parameters in ways not possible with the higher-level recipes.\n","    * **Access to Primitives:** It provides direct access to algorithms like various hashing functions (SHA256, MD5, etc.), symmetric ciphers (AES, ChaCha20), asymmetric algorithms (RSA, ECC), key derivation functions (PBKDF2, scrypt, HKDF), and more.\n","    * **Underlying Implementations:** The higher-level \"recipes\" often build upon the \"hazmat\" primitives internally.\n","\n","* **When to Use Hazmat:**\n","    * **Only when absolutely necessary:** The library strongly recommends using the higher-level recipes whenever possible.\n","    * **Deep understanding required:** If you're working with the hazmat layer, you are expected to have a thorough understanding of the cryptographic concepts involved, the potential pitfalls, and how to correctly apply these primitives.

This means both the sender and receiver of the encrypted data must possess the same key.\n","  * **Authenticated Encryption:** Beyond just confidentiality (keeping the data secret), Fernet also provides:\n","      * **Integrity:** It ensures that the encrypted data has not been tampered with since it was encrypted. If even a single bit is changed, decryption will fail.\n","      * **Authenticity:** It verifies that the data originated from someone who possessed the correct key, preventing unauthorized parties from forging messages.\n","  * **Opinionated Design:** Fernet simplifies cryptographic best practices by bundling together several robust algorithms and automatically handling details like:\n","      * **Key generation:** It provides a simple `Fernet.generate_key()` method.\n","      * **Initialization Vectors (IVs):** These are random values used to ensure that encrypting the same plaintext multiple times results in different ciphertext, preventing certain attacks. Fernet handles IV generation automatically.\n","      * **Padding:** It manages the necessary padding for block ciphers like AES.\n","      * **Timestamps:** Fernet tokens include a timestamp of when they were created, which can be used to set a Time-To-Live (TTL) for the token, making it expire after a certain period.\n","  * **Underlying Algorithms:** Fernet combines the following cryptographic primitives (from the \"hazmat\" layer of `cryptography`) to achieve its security guarantees:\n","      * **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode with a 128-bit key:** This provides the core confidentiality.\n","      * **HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) using SHA256:** This provides the integrity and authenticity.\n","      * **`os.urandom()` for random number generation:** Used for generating secure IVs.\n","  * **\"Fernet Token\":** The output of a Fernet encryption is often referred to as a \"Fernet token.\" This token is URL-safe base64-encoded and contains the version, timestamp, IV, ciphertext, and HMAC, all bundled together.\n","\n","**When to Use Fernet:**\n","\n","Fernet is ideal for situations where you need to encrypt relatively small pieces of data (e.g., configuration files, user tokens, sensitive strings) and want a straightforward, secure, and opinionated solution.

Asimetrik şifrelemede her iki tarafın da genel anahtarlara güvenmesi gerekir. PKI, bu güveni oluşturmak için bir sistem sağlar.\n","\n","**Sertifika Yetkilileri (CA):** Güvenilir üçüncü taraflar olarak işlev görürler. Bir genel anahtarı belirli bir kimliğe (örneğin bir web sitesi veya kişi) bağlayan dijital sertifikaları yayınlar ve imzalar.\n","\n","**Dijital Sertifikalar:** Bir genel anahtarı, anahtar sahibinin kimliği (alan adı, kuruluş adı vb.) ve CA'nın dijital imzası gibi bilgilerle birlikte içeren belgelerdir. Bu imza, sertifikanın CA tarafından verildiğini ve üzerinde oynanmadığını doğrular.\n","\n","**Güven Zinciri:** Tarayıcılara ve işletim sistemlerine önceden yüklenmiş kök CA sertifikalarından başlayarak, sertifikaların hiyerarşik bir şekilde doğrulanmasıdır. Bir sertifika, bir üst düzey CA tarafından imzalandığında, bu üst düzey CA'ya duyulan güven altındaki sertifikaya da aktarılır ve bir güven zinciri oluşturulur.\n","\n","**Kod Örneği Hakkında Not:**\n","\n","Bu yeni kavramlar (PKI, CA'lar, Dijital Sertifikalar, Güven Zinciri), tek başına Python koduyla basitçe \"üretilebilecek\" kavramlar değildir(Diğer notebookta kısmen yapmış olduk). Bunlar, anahtar oluşturma ve şifreleme gibi temel kriptografik işlemleri (bir önceki örnekte gösterilen) kullanarak inşa edilen karmaşık altyapı ve sistem tasarımlarıdır.\n","\n","Örneğin, bir Sertifika Yetkilisi (CA) oluşturmak veya tam teşekküllü bir PKI uygulamak, sertifika yaşam döngüsü yönetimi, CRL'ler (Sertifika İptal Listeleri), OCSP (Çevrimiçi Sertifika Durumu Protokolü) ve güvenli anahtar depolama gibi birçok bileşeni içeren büyük ve karmaşık bir projedir. Bu nedenle, bu konseptlerin doğrudan ve anlamlı bir kod örneğini tek bir kısa snippet olarak sağlamak mümkün değildir.\n","\n","Ancak, Python'daki requests veya ssl gibi kütüphaneler aracılığıyla mevcut bir PKI altyapısıyla (örneğin bir HTTPS web sitesiyle iletişim kurarken) nasıl etkileşime geçileceğini gösteren kodlar yazılabilir. Bu tür kodlar, PKI'yı kullanır, ancak PKI'yı uygulamaz. İsteğiniz bu yönde olsaydı, buna yönelik bir örnek sağlayabilirdim.\n","\n","Önceki videoda gördüğünüz temel asimetrik şifreleme kod örneği, PKI'nın üzerine inşa edildiği kriptografik temeli oluşturmaktadır. PKI, bu temel kriptografik işlemleri büyük ölçekte ve güvenilir bir şekilde kullanmayı mümkün kılan bir \"güven katmanı\" ekler.\n","\n","------\n","\n","PKI'nın günlük kullanımındaki en önemli yerlerden biri, güvenli web iletişimidir (HTTPS). Python'ın requests kütüphanesi, web istekleri yaparken bu güvenliği otomatik olarak yönetir. Bu yönetim altında yatan mekanizma ise ssl (Secure Sockets Layer) modülünü ve işletim sisteminizin PKI güven zincirini kullanmaktır.\n","\n","Aşağıdaki kod örneği, requests kütüphanesini kullanarak güvenli bir web sitesine (HTTPS) nasıl istek atacağınızı gösterir.
